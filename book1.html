            An exiled prince searching for the truth. A curious squire desperate
            to prove himself. An epic romance that will change the world.
          </h1>
          <h2>
            Sixteen-year-old Prince Anden has no memory of the night his father
            died. People say he caused the accident; his brother the king has
            never forgiven him. Now, years later and exiled in disgrace, Anden
            receives a mysterious note.
          </h2>
          <h3>
            "You didn't slip. You were pushed. Your father didn't drown. He was
            murdered."
          </h3>
          <h4>
            Anden falls for mischievous palace squire River, but the timing
            couldn’t be worse. He returns home to find his kingdom threatened by
            enemy states on all sides, his brother about to come of age, and
            their uncle the Lord Regent making moves to usurp the throne. Anden
            must race to uncover a decades-old conspiracy before it destroys his
            kingdom, his family, and the boy he loves.
